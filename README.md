# Distributed Time Consensus System

A decentralized system for achieving consensus on time using GPS satellites and zero-knowledge proofs, without relying on a central authority.

## Overview

This system provides a trust-minimized approach to maintaining accurate time across a distributed network by:

1. Using GPS satellite data for initial time synchronization
2. Implementing zero-knowledge proofs for time validation
3. Leveraging BFT consensus for network-wide time agreement
4. Preventing replay attacks through cryptographic fingerprinting
5. Enabling real-time price discovery through ordered transactions

## Architecture

### Key Components

1. **GPS Module**
   - Receives signals from multiple satellites
   - Processes PRN codes and ephemeris data
   - Calculates precise timing information

2. **Secure Enclave**
   - Validates GPS module output
   - Runs ZK circuits for time verification
   - Generates cryptographic proofs

3. **Validation Engine**
   - Verifies time proofs from other nodes
   - Implements BFT consensus rules
   - Maintains accepted time ranges

4. **Network Layer**
   - Handles peer-to-peer communication
   - Propagates time proofs
   - Manages validator connections

5. **Data Availability Layer**
   - Stores validated time proofs
   - Maintains consensus history
   - Enables proof verification

### Security Model

- Minimum 4 satellites required for triangulation
- Network requires 400+ validators for security
- BFT consensus with 2/3 + 1 agreement
- Protection against replay attacks via fingerprinting
- Slashing conditions for malicious validators

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- GPS receiver module
- Secure hardware enclave
- Network connectivity

   - Minimum 4 non-colluding satellites
   - Sufficient network size for validator coverage
   - Honest majority of validators

2. **Attack Vectors**
   - Clock slowing attacks
   - Replay attacks
   - Validator collusion
   - GPS signal spoofing
